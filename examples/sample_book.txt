# Chapter 1: The Discovery

The old garden gate creaked as Sarah pushed it open. Moonlight filtered through ancient oak trees, casting silver shadows across the overgrown path.

"Hello?" she called softly into the darkness. "Is anyone there?"

No answer came. Only the whisper of wind through leaves.

Sarah stepped forward, her heart pounding. The garden seemed to breathe around her, alive with secrets waiting to be discovered.

"You shouldn't be here," said a voice from the shadows.

Sarah spun around. "Who's there?"

A figure emerged from behind a rose bush. It was an old man, his white beard gleaming in the moonlight.

"I'm the gardener," he said gruffly. "This is private property."

"I'm sorry," Sarah replied nervously. "The gate was open, and I thought—"

"Thought what?" The gardener's eyes narrowed. "That you could just wander in?"

Sarah took a step back. "I didn't mean any harm."

The old man's expression softened. "No, I suppose you didn't." He sighed heavily. "Very few do, when they first arrive."

# Chapter 2: The Secret

The gardener led Sarah deeper into the garden. Strange flowers bloomed in impossible colors—purple roses, blue sunflowers, silver lilies that seemed to glow from within.

"What is this place?" Sarah whispered in wonder.

"It's the Midnight Garden," the gardener explained. "A place between worlds. It only appears when the moon is full."

"That's impossible," said Sarah, though even as she spoke, she knew it wasn't.

The gardener chuckled. "Many things are impossible, child. Until they aren't."

They stopped before a ancient fountain. The water sparkled with starlight.

"Make a wish," the gardener said softly.

Sarah hesitated. "What kind of wish?"

"The truest one in your heart."

Sarah closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she was standing alone in an ordinary garden. The moon had set. The magic was gone.

But in her hand, she held a single silver lily—proof that some impossible things are very real indeed.
