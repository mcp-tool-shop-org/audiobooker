# Chapter 1: The Meeting

The café was quiet in the late afternoon. Sarah sat by the window, watching raindrops trace paths down the glass.

"You're early," said Marcus, sliding into the seat across from her.

"I'm always early," Sarah replied. "You know that."

Marcus smiled. "Fair enough." He signaled the waiter. "Two coffees, please."

Sarah leaned forward. "So what did you want to talk about?"

"The project," Marcus said quietly. "There's been a complication."

[Sarah|worried] "What kind of complication?"

Marcus hesitated. "The kind that keeps me up at night."

The waiter arrived with their drinks. Neither spoke until he left.

"Tell me everything," Sarah whispered.

# Chapter 2: The Revelation

Marcus pulled a folder from his bag. His hands trembled slightly.

"I found this in the old archives," he explained. "No one was supposed to see it."

Sarah opened the folder carefully. Inside were photographs, yellowed documents, handwritten notes in faded ink.

"This is from 1952," she said. "What does it have to do with our project?"

"Everything," Marcus replied grimly. "Look at page three."

She turned the pages. When she reached the third document, her eyes widened.

[Sarah|shocked] "This can't be real."

"I thought the same thing," said Marcus. "But I've verified it three times."

Sarah closed the folder. "If this gets out..."

"Exactly." Marcus took a long sip of his coffee. "Now you understand why I couldn't discuss this over the phone."

The rain continued falling outside. Neither of them noticed.
